Three pillars to write good HTML and CSS and build good websites

-Responsive web design
build one website that works beautifully across all screen sizes and web browsers

fluid layouts, media queries, responsive images, correct units, desktop-first vs. mobile-first

-Maintainable and scalable code
code that is clean, easy to understand, able to grow, reusable, organized files, class names, well-structured HTML --> we need to care about our css structure and our mark-up in html

-Web performance
make as few HTTP requests as possible, write as little code as possible, compress our code, use a CSS preprocessor (like SASS), fewer images, compress our images so that they use less bandwidth for our end user

what actually happens to our CSS code behind the scenes when we load up a webpage?

http request, domain name service... etc

what happens in the browser when a user opens the page --> Load HTML, then parse it --> read it line by line

browser build the DOM which describes the document like tree --> this stores all the html
as it parses the html, it loads the css

when css is parsed, it (1) resolves conflicting css desclarations and then creates a cascade
and then it (2) processes final css values, such as margins and and dimensions that are declared with % values or other relative values into pixels for different screen sizes

then it takes the parsed CSS and creates the CSS Object model (CSSOM)--> similar to DOM and it creates a render tree which then becomes the visual formatting model for website rendering, which then gets rendered to the browser

CSS Parsing phase
